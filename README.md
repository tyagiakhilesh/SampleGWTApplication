# SampleGWTApplication

My first attempt to working with Google Web Toolkit.
```
mvn clean         # delete temporary stuff
mvn test          # run all the tests (gwt and junit)
mvn gwt:devmode   # run development mode (needs "mvn package" to be run before)
mvn package       # generate a .war package ready to deploy
```

For more information about other available goals, read Maven and gwt-maven-plugin 
documentation (http://maven.apache.org, https://tbroyer.github.io/gwt-maven-plugin/)
